    <h1>The problem with the poverty line</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Hussain "Zain" Kanji</p>
    
    <p>In the United States, nearly 41 million people live below the poverty line <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2023.S1701?q=poverty">according to the Census Bureau</a>. However, that number does not account for the millions of Americans struggling just to get by.</p>
    
    <p>"I have some real qualms about how we measure poverty in the United States," said Dr. Margaret Thomas, an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. "And the shortcomings of our official poverty line."</p>
    
    <p>The current poverty line is adjusted every year with a system developed in the 1960s.</p>

    <p>According to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how_print.pdf">June 2022 Census Bureau infographic</a>, "the official measure is three times the cost of a minimum food diet from 1963 (in today's prices)."</p>
    
    <p>The Census does measure poverty in another way, called the <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2021/demo/poverty_measure-how_print.pdf">Supplemental Poverty Measure</a>. While SPM is a more comprehensive tool, it is not used to determine anything official and already integrates any government assistance and taxes. It has not been updated since June 2022.</p>
    
    <p>While the US government has spent countless billions on finding new ways to address poverty, the same algorithm from the 1960s is being used to calculate benefits such as tax exemptions, food stamps and Medicaid. These programs exist to help the people who cannot afford the cost. However, with the way the poverty line is calculated, the class of Americans struggling to get by expands year over year.</p>
    
    <p>"We ought to gather information about people's experiences of material hardship because we would know a lot more about (their) economic well-being," said Dr. Thomas.</p>
    
    <h2>Measuring using material hardships</h2>
    
    <p>The purpose of measuring using material hardships is to understand the need an individual or family has when it comes to meeting basic survival requirements such as food, shelter and medical care. Measuring with this method allows for a comprehensive understanding of all the countless aspects that can add to financial burden for someone and their family.</p>
    
    <p>This approach is not new, especially to the US. Over two decades ago, in 2004, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/measures-material-hardship#:~:text=Based%20on%20a%20synthesis%20of%20research%20by%20European%20and%20US,preferences%20on%20observed%20living%20conditions.">released a study on material hardships</a>. While it goes in-depth on the significance of measuring with material hardships, it does not state a way to implement them on a national scale. It instead explains that more research is needed on the topic.</p>
    
    <p>Yet, 21 years since the report, the only change has been independent research institutions taking the mantel on researching material hardships -- while the US government continues to measure assistance for its poorest citizens with something that was created before the first man walked on the moon.</p>
    
    <p>"We know that material hardship is a lot more common than income poverty and we could have a much more holistic picture of what people's needs are by collecting that data," said Dr. Thomas. "And then we could maybe figure out better policy solutions."</p>

    <p>Despite research and development for a new way to measure poverty in America, the main issue boils down to variability.</p>
    
    <p>It is much more predictable, and in turn simple, to calculate the poverty line by the same standard over the contiguous US than to add variables such as regions. Without additional complexity to the gargantuan system that afflicts millions of Americans, the financial chokehold to just skate by in this country continues to tighten its grip.</p>
    
    <h2>The issue with measuring with a tool from the '60s</h2>
    
    <p>The most recent <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap">SNAP benefit data</a> from the Department of Agriculture reports a single person can receive a maximum of $292 a month. To make that last an entire month, with an average of three meals a day, that single person needs to only spend $3.24 per meal.</p>
    
    <div class="visualization-container">
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/22077328">

        </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>To average that number is extremely difficult to achieve, especially when accounting for the 23.6% increase in food prices in the US between 2020 and 2024, according to <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-prices-and-spending#:~:text=U.S.%20food%20prices%20rose%20by%2023.6%20percent%20from%202020%20to%202024&text=In%202022%2C%20food%20prices%20increased,such%20as%20high%20energy%20costs.">a separate report from the agriculture department</a>.</p>
    
    <p>For a single person who is making $15,000 a year, or a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, it simply is just not enough. <a href="https://www.apartments.com/rent-market-trends/us/">Apartments.com reports</a> the average rent price as of March 2025 is $1,559 a month. The single person already cannot afford it and the family of four living paycheck to paycheck with only $975 from SNAP is not getting enough assistance to get them out of the hole.</p>
    
    <p>More than two in five Americans cannot afford a $1000 surprise expense according to <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/emergency-savings-report/">Bankrate's 2025 report</a>. There are two stark problems: the least fortunate are not receiving enough support and the government does not think people living paycheck to paycheck need assistance -- when assistance is the only way for them to financially recover.</p>
    
    <p>There are so many factors that affect people of all ages, races and incomes in the US. This is a core issue that not only affects people at the bottom of the financial food chain, but all taxpayers. There is a disconnect between understanding how the government uses the money it collects.</p>
    
    <p>The system needs to be adjusted past a model of yesteryear and developed to sustain future generations.</p>
